👀 I’m interested digital marketing, around social and environmental justice issues. I have years of experience with consultative sales. I am looking for ways to leverage my experience with sales and interest in marketing, and social justice, into cleaver money making marketing opportunities.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, jQuery, applying this to UX/UI. Of course this is not all am learning now, but the most relevant to GIT another thing I am learning.


With GreenMeansUSA I hope to grow my independent marketing experience and make a positive impact.  The focus here is on all the things I can do in the moment. More will be coming.  

💞️ My first priority is to collaborate on faster learning and applying lessons to projects around environmental and social justice. I was once called a lone wolf; I did not like it. Having years of experience in consultative sales and growing hands-on experience with digital marketing I hope to leverage my skill set and interest for life changing collaborative opportunities.
