     Do we really care about this earth, and how sustainable it will be for up coming generations?  We are more powerful than we give ourselves for when it comes to climate change.  Consider the evidence in documentaries like “Cowspricy, they claim that the gases released especially from cow farts and dung, methane and nitrous oxide, are many more times damaging than the CO2 that we often think of when it comes to climate change.
                     
                     
</p>                    
  

                      <p>
They seem to claim that reducing methane and nitrous oxide would not only have a more immediate pay off but that it is these that do most of the damage, but it is also these that bring the our personal commitment, or lack there of to leaving this place better, or at least not as damaged to those that will come after us.
                     
                     </p>
  

                      <p>
The idea is simple. Make a choice with your dollars not to contribute to any industry that produces these gases, unless we absolutely have to.  One way many find of doing this is cutting out eating dead animals.  If you must eat flesh try pouncing on some unsuspecting pig, cow, or sheep.  Grab it by the hands and bight directly on its throat.  This should kill the animal and give you a first reward for chasing down the animal in the first place.  If you cant do this, maybe you should not eat it.  
Some say there is a benefit to learning this limitation.  Without eating this dead flesh we ca avoid it’s fat getting into our veins and arteries.  I use to not care so much about those things until I realized that this is how a man’s fun stuff works!  I am a man and I want to keep mines working without calling my Dr and asking if I am healthy enough to engage the junk, and will he give me some pills because it wont go up without them.  Saving the world is just a side benefit!
                     </p>
  

                     
                      <p>
         Do Christians care about climate change? If so what would Jesus do?  We cannot consider all Christians, many who expect his return in there life time say that worry about future generations is waist.  They already know the earth is only good for another 50 years or so, so then there is no need to preserve this.  Jesus will be back soon enough so the grand kids wont be affected, perhaps born in heaven.   But what if Jesus comes back later than you think? 
                             </p>

                             <p>
            This leaves us the Christian who will actually ask him or herself  “if Jesus was around and learned that crossing off a menu item would make sure others were not hungry, and preserve the sustainability of the earth would he simply not eat that thing?  Or would he think about it, prey and meditate on it.  As an atheist I see animals as my fellow earth travelers.  I have no right over them, and live is hard enough without me adding to suffering.  This is the only life I know I will have and it’s the same for other animals.  I want to have  as much fun and joy as I can, and that includes junk that works well without the permission of my DR.

                       Some of my new favorite foods are vegan foods.  I am evolving out-loud, part of this is growing from a person that would eat food that would be a part of my addictions I did not know that I had.  Now that I know I can be addicted to food here is what I am doing.
